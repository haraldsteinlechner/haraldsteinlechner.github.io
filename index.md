### Cutting edge technology for real-world applications

With over 15 years of experience in applied research and industry projects my focus is on providing cutting-edge technologies and insights to your applications: Consulting & courses, concept, analysis of optimization potential and implementation of tailormade components. My courses can be held online, or in-person in austria / central europe.

### Courses

I provide customized courses for algorithms and software technolgy, for example:
 - Functional Programming
 - Concurrency & Parallel Programming
 - Performance Optimization

##### Functional Programming courses

In 2007 my first functional programming efforts went into the [aardvark rendering engine](https://aardvarkians.com/) (also on [github](https://github.com/aardvark-platform)). 
I repeateatly experienced exceptional productivity boost via functional programming principles.

Given the concrete background of the course participants, I tailor my course accordingly.
The basis is:
 - FP on familiar terrain: Most programmers know Functional Style. Here we familiarize ourselfs with the paradigm and develop a real-world example, which shows the advantages of FP.
 - Deep Dive - Functional Concepts: Next, we look at a broad range of functional concepts such as lazy evaluation and pure functions, their advantages and real-world use-cases.
 - Immutable Data: Background and advantages for robustness, testing, parallel execution.
 - We look at how large scale systems can be designed functionally. Next, we look at UI systems and highlight design considerations for modern functional style systems.

Depending on your needs, i tailor the course to your programming environment and language (C#, Java, F#, Haskell, Typescript, Javascript, C++). Duration and blocking is up to your choice.

##### Concurrency & Practical Parallel Programming Courses

Most systems face concurrent programming challenge. I show how to tackle them using simple patterns.
In my parallel programming course we discuss parallel programming patterns with focus on usability, abstraction
and performance characteristics.

I will tailor the course depending on your environment and programming language (classic choices are (but not limited to) C#, Java, C++, F#, Haskell).
