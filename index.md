### Cutting edge technology for real-world applications

With over 15 years of experience in research and industry projects my focus is in providing
real-world use-cases with cutting edge technology.

### Courses

I provide customized courses for topics in IT. The focus is on:
 - Functional Programming
 - Concurrency & Parallel Programming
 - Performance Optimization

##### FP courses

In 2007 my first functional programming efforts went into the aardvark rendering engine. 
I repeateatly experienced exceptional productivity boost via functional programming principles.

Given the concrete background of the course participants, i tailor my course accordingly.
The basis is:
 - FP on familiar terrain: Most programmers know Functional Style. In this lecture we familiarize with the paradigm and develop a real-world example which shows the advantages of FP.
 - Deep Dive - Functional Concepts: In this lecture we look at a broad range of functional concepts such as lazy evaluation and pure functions
 - Immutable Data: In this data we introduce immutable data, and show their advantages for robustness, testing, parallel execution.
 - In this lecture we show how large scale systems can be designed functionally. We show functional UI systems and highlight design considerations for modern functional style systems.


##### Concurrency & Practical Parallel Programming Courses

Most systems face concurrent programming challenge. I show how to tackle them using simple patterns.
In my parallel programming we discuss parallel programming patterns with focus on usability, abstraction
and performance characteristics.
